EZService - Simplifying Fedora Service Definition & Deployment
--------------------------------------------------------------

============
Introduction
============

This utility includes stylesheets generate Fedora Service Definition 
and Deployment objects from simple XML input files.  This technique
is much easier to understand (and less error-prone) than creating
SDef and SDep FOXML objects by hand.

==========
How to use
==========

1. Write your service definition in the "EZDef" format.
   For example EZDef files, see the examples/ directory.

2. Write one or more service deployments in the "EZDep" format.
   Again, see the examples/ directory.

3. Run your EZDef file through the ezdef.xsl stylesheet.

   The ezdef.sh script will do this for you, printing the
   resulting FOXML to standard output.

   Usage:
       ./ezdef.sh path/to/your-ezdef.xml

   Or, to write to a file:
       ./ezdef.sh path/to/your-ezdef.xml > your-sdef-foxml.xml

4. Run your EZDep file(s) through the ezdep.xsl stylesheet.
   This stylesheet takes a parameter; "ezdef", which is the
   path to the associated EZDep file.

   The ezdep.sh script will do this for you, printing the
   resulting FOXML to standard output.

   Usage:
       ./ezdep.sh path/to/your-ezdep.xml path/to/your-ezdef.xml

   Or, to write to a file:
       ./ezdep.sh path/to/your-ezdep.xml path/to/your-ezdef > your-sdep-foxml.xml

5. Ingest your generated Service Definition FOXML files into Fedora

Canonical Example:

./ezdef.sh examples/canonical/ezdef.xml > sdef-foxml.xml
./ezdep.sh examples/canonical/ezdep.xml examples/canonical/ezdef.xml > sdep-foxml.xml
